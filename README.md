# KMeans
The Mall Customer Segmentation Dataset was used. The dataset was first cleaned and OneHotEncoder was used to encode categorical features. PCA was used to compress the dataset into 2 dimensions. The elbow method was used to obtain the oprimal value of K. It turned out to be 5. The clusters were plotted using MatPlotLib and were visualised. The Silhouette Score was also printed.
